# MKMBA Github Infrastructure

This repository contains common Github infrastructure that is re-used across multiple MKMBA Limited repositories.

This repository is public not because any of this infrastructure is intended to be published, shared or re-used
outside of MKMBA Limited, but as a convenience for allowing re-use of the infrastructure in public projects (e.g.
forks of public repositories) which would otherwise be prevented by GitHub's rules around how actions and
workflows are re-used:

# MKMBA Limited Internal Instructions

* Keep any actions/workflows committed to this reposistory relatively generic to avoid unintentionally revealing
  production environment details or secrets.
